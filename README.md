# Radio-Waves-to-Image-Film
This repo allows people to transform radiowaves from channels they pick to images (frames) then film based on a some algorithms for image/frame construction

# Vizualization

So every frame is output in a sequence according to chunk size set on the 2D_cartesian_grid scripts. By default it is set to half of input max... for chunk time we can do chunk_time = chunk_size / input_max... I will update script with this so it is more straight forward when running... for a short IQ binary file it would look like this.

It is shown as this... 

# Compression
Please go to https://github.com/PaulsGitHubs/IQ-Sample-Compression-with-FFT-and-DWT for compressing the data. You will be able to compress it with DWT, then decompress it to FFT, IQ samples, etc :)

Fun stuff :)
