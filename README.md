# Radio-Waves-to-Image-Film
This repo allows people to transform radiowaves from channels they pick to images (frames) then film based on a some algorithms for image/frame construction

# Compression
Please go to https://github.com/PaulsGitHubs/IQ-Sample-Compression-with-FFT-and-DWT for compressing the data. You will be able to compress it with DWT, then decompress it to FFT, IQ samples, etc :)

Fun stuff :)
